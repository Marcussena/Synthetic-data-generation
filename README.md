# Simulated Data Generation for Data Science and Machine Learning
This repository contains comprehensive examples and tutorials on generating simulated data for data science, machine learning, and academic projects. It covers a variety of techniques using Python libraries such as NumPy, SciPy, and SDV (Synthetic Data Vault).

Overview
Creating high-quality synthetic data is crucial for developing, testing, and validating data science models. This repository explores several methods to generate simulated data that mimic real-world scenarios, helping you to enhance your analysis, model performance, and data understanding.

Contents
1. Generating Low and High-Dimensional Data
Low-Dimensional Gaussian Data: Generating low-dimensional data from a Gaussian distribution and projecting it into higher dimensions.
Noise Addition: Adding noise to high-dimensional data to simulate real-world imperfections.
2. Using Statistical Distributions with SciPy
Beta Distribution
Gamma Distribution
Weibull Distribution
Log-Normal Distribution
Pareto Distribution
Exponential Distribution
Binomial Distribution
Poisson Distribution
Chi-Square Distribution
T-Distribution
F-Distribution
Uniform Distribution
3. Synthetic Data with SDV
Gaussian Copula Model: Using SDV to generate synthetic data while preserving the statistical properties of the original dataset.
Demo Datasets: Leveraging built-in demo datasets from SDV for practice and experimentation.
4. Practical Applications
Data Privacy: Generating synthetic data to maintain privacy while preserving the utility for analysis.
Data Augmentation: Enhancing datasets with synthetic data for improved model training and testing.
Model Testing: Using synthetic data to rigorously test machine learning models under various conditions.
Bias and Fairness Analysis: Creating balanced datasets to analyze and mitigate biases in models.
